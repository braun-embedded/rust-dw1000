# Rust DW1000 Driver [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/dw1000.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/dw1000) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/dw1000/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/dw1000) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braun-robotics/rust-dw1000.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braun-robotics/rust-dw1000)

## Introduction

Driver for the Decawave [DW1000] UWB transceiver, written in the [Rust] programming language. If you're using the DW1000 with a DWM1001 module or a DWM1001-Dev board, please check out the [DWM1001 crate].

[DWM1001 crate]: https://crates.io/crates/dwm1001


## Status

This driver covers the main features of the DW1000, wireless communication and distance measurement, although the distance measurement is currently lacking range bias compensation, making it somewhat imprecise.

As of this writing, the driver is well-tested (see [examples]), but has yet to be proven in real-world use cases.

This project is still in development. No guarantee of API stability is made, so expect future versions to require updates in your code.


## Usage

Include this crate in your Cargo project by adding the following to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
dw1000 = "0.1"
```


## Documentation

Please refer to the **[API Reference]** and the [examples].

[Example programs] are available in the rust-dwm1001 repository.
